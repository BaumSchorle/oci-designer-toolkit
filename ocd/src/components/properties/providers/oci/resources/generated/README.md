# Auto Generated React TypeScript files

This directory contains the Auto Generated TypeScript (__.tsx__) files containing the React components used by the 
React resource property definition files in the above directory (which will not be Automatically generated). The contents of this directory will not
be added to GitHub because they can be generated during the build process.

To Generate these files the user must execute the following commands within the **codegen** directory.

```bash
npm install
npm run import-oci-terraform-schema 
npm run generate-oci-properties
```
